# BreathGTK

# Requirements

- GTK+ 3.16

# Install instructions
If your distribution doesn't provide a package, you can install the theme system-wide by copying it to the appropriate directory, usually "/usr/share/themes".

To install only for the current user, copy the files to "~/.themes".

To set the theme in Plasma 5, install kde-gtk-config and use System Settings > Application Style > GNOME Application Style.
Also make sure to disable "apply colors to non-Qt applications" in System Settings > Colors > Options.
